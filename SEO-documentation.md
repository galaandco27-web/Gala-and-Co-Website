**Prepared for:** SEO Team

**Date:** February 2026
**Document covers:** All on-page SEO, technical SEO, structured data, performance, and accessibility implementations across the four-page static website.

## 1. Architecture — Why It Matters for SEO

The site was **converted from a JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA)** to a fully static, multi-page HTML site. This is the most impactful SEO change made.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| React SPA — content rendered client-side by JS | Static HTML — all content in the raw HTML source |
| Single `index.html`, one shared `<title>` | 4 separate `.html` files, each with unique metadata |
| Googlebot had to execute JS to see content | Googlebot reads content instantly, no JS required |
| No `sitemap.xml` | `sitemap.xml` listing all 4 URLs |
| No `robots.txt` | `robots.txt` present |

> **Impact:** Full and immediate crawl visibility for every word, heading, image, and link on the site.

## 4. Open Graph (Social Sharing) Tags

Implemented on all 4 pages. Enables rich previews when shared on LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.

```html
<!-- Example from index.html -->
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:title" content="Gala & Co | Luxury Real Estate Advisory & Contracting Mumbai" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Gala & Co delivers premium real estate advisory and world-class contracting in Mumbai. 50+ landmark projects, 12 years of excellence." />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://galaandco.com/" />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://galaandco.com/assets/images/hero-building.jpg" />
```

Each page has a **unique OG image** pointing to the most relevant imagery for that page.

| Page | OG Image |
|---|---|
| Home | `hero-building.jpg` |
| About | `lifestyle-interior.jpg` |
| Services | `project-commercial.jpg` |
| Contact | `hero-building.jpg` |

## 6. Semantic HTML5 Structure

Every page uses correct, crawler-readable semantic tags:

| Element | Usage |
|---|---|
| `<html lang="en">` | Language declared on every page |
| `<header role="banner">` | Site header, crawlable navigation |
| `<nav aria-label="Primary navigation">` | Named navigation landmark |
| `<main id="main-content">` | Primary content area, skip-linked |
| `<section aria-labelledby="...">` | Each content section with heading ID reference |
| `<article>` | Each service and project card |
| `<address>` | Business contact information (on index + contact) |
| `<footer role="contentinfo">` | Footer with labelled navigation |
| `<figure>` + `<figcaption>` | Semantic image containers on services page |

---

## 7. Heading Hierarchy

Each page has **exactly one `<h1>`** with a clear heading hierarchy below it. There is no skipping of levels.

| Page | H1 | H2 Example | H3 Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| index.html | "Shaping Spaces That Reflect You" | "We Don't Build Properties..." | "Real Estate Advisory" |
| about.html | "About Gala & Co" | "We Don't Build Properties..." | "Precision" / "Legacy" |
| services.html | "Two Pillars. One Standard." | "Real Estate Advisory" / "Contracting" | — |
| contact.html | "Contact Gala & Co" | "Let's Create Something Extraordinary." | — |

---

## 8. Image SEO

All 6 images across the site are fully optimised for search engines.

| Image | Alt Text | Dimensions | Loading |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hero-building.jpg` (hero) | "Luxury high-rise building by Gala & Co real estate" | 1920×1080 | `fetchpriority="high"` |
| `hero-building.jpg` (section) | "Landmark luxury building developed by Gala & Co in Mumbai" | 1920×1080 | default |
| `lifestyle-interior.jpg` | "Luxury interior design by Gala & Co — premium residential space in Mumbai" | 800×1067 | `loading="lazy"` |
| `project-commercial.jpg` | "Gala & Co real estate advisory — premium commercial property analysis" | 800×450 | `loading="lazy"` |
| `project-construction.jpg` | "Gala & Co construction and contracting — luxury building under development" | 800×450 | `loading="lazy"` |

| `project-commercial.jpg` (projects) | "The Commerce Hub — premium commercial development by Gala & Co" | 800×600 | `loading="lazy"` |

All `alt` texts follow the pattern: **[Project/Item name] — [descriptive context] by Gala & Co [+ location]**.

---

## 9. Canonical URLs

Every page declares its own canonical to prevent duplicate content issues:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<link rel="canonical" href="https://galaandco.com/" />

<!-- about.html -->
<link rel="canonical" href="https://galaandco.com/about" />

## 12. Page Speed & Core Web Vitals Optimisations

| Optimisation | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **No render-blocking JS** | `<script src="js/main.js" defer>` on all pages |

| **Single CSS file** | One HTTP request for all styles |

## 13. Accessibility (Affects SEO)

Google's crawlers use the accessibility tree as part of their quality signals.

| Implementation | Tag/Attribute |
|---|---|
| Skip-to-content link | `<a class="skip-link" href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>` |
| ARIA roles on regions | `role="banner"`, `role="contentinfo"`, `role="dialog"`, `role="list"` |
| Named navigations | `aria-label="Primary navigation"`, `aria-label="Footer navigation"` |
| Section headings linked | `aria-labelledby="[heading-id]"` on every `<section>` |
| Hamburger button | `aria-label="Toggle navigation menu"` + `aria-expanded="false"` |
| Decorative elements hidden | `aria-hidden="true"` on SVG, overlays, dividers |
| Form accessibility | `<label for="...">` paired with every `<input>` |
| Live region for form success | `role="status" aria-live="polite"` on success message |
| Projects grid | `role="list"` on grid + `role="listitem"` + `aria-label` on each card |

---

## 14. Internal Linking Structure

All inter-page links use descriptive anchor text and correct paths.

```
index.html ──→ about.html, services.html, contact.html, #about, #services, #projects, #contact
about.html ──→ index.html, services.html, contact.html, index.html#projects
services.html ──→ index.html, about.html, contact.html, index.html#projects
contact.html ──→ index.html, about.html, services.html, index.html#projects
```

The logo on every page links back to `index.html` with `aria-label="Gala & Co — Home"`.

Contact click-to-call and click-to-email links are present and crawlable:
```html
<a href="tel:+919876543210">+91 98765 43210</a>
<a href="mailto:galaandco27@gmail.com">galaandco27@gmail.com</a>
```

---

## 15. Tracking — Google Analytics 4

A GA4 snippet placeholder is present in the `<head>` of all 4 pages, loaded `async` (non-blocking):

```html
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
